<pre>
<b>Part 1: History Repeats Itself</b>

The king's onto something new.
I plan to escape the rule,
Set for a new frontier
And I will make my way from here.

I won't make this journey alone.
So many people ask to go.

Meet new indigene man,
Learn how to farm his land.
We all misunderstand
And I will hunt them down, yeah.

I wrote this history alone
And I will call this place home.

<b>Part 2: His Story Repeats Itself</b>

Oh, the seasons change
Though, they end up the same.
All that I see here is gray.
Thrown in the obliterator,
Trying to get away,
Wanting to make this place
A better home for you and me.

Driving now for hours,
Leaping to the next town.
Have I been disgraced,
Leaving nothing but a trace?

The belief that my "perfect life"
Is just a step away,
Well, it leads me nowhere
But, left out,
Turning sour,
Been forgotten, forever. . .

All the lonely hours
I spent wondering what
Happened to all the ones I'd loved,
Born from the family what I was.
