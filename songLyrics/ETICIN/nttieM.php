<h3>Naked to the Invisible Eye</h3>
<pre>
<img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> woke this morning,
To an alarm
<img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> wanted to throw,
With so many places
<img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> wanted to be
And <img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> wanted to go.
<img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> can't make up my mind;
To live in the daily grind
Or run for my life
<span id="big">Or go back to <span id="bigger">sleep.</span></span>

<img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> couldn't leave 
If <img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> wanted to.
<img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> want to stay for
Everyone <img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> know
And it eludes me.
What is it to me?
What is making me so crazy?
Honestly, <img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> can't let go.

<img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> guess, <img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" />'ll give up on
Starting my own society
And doing the things
That <img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> want to
And try to act like an "adult"
Because, <img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> want more
To be happy with myself;
Even if that means
<img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /><span id="big">'ve got to act tough
And pretend it's alright</span>

But, <img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> guess that, for me,
If <img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" />'m coming clean,
<img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" /> can't understand
Why <img src="../../images/eye.png" alt="eye" />'m the only one
To point things out like these.
Why is it there have been
All the TIMEs that have made me
So completely insane? Woah,
You've got the best of me.
