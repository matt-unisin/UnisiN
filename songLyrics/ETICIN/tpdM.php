<h3>The Power Dangers</h3>
<pre>
Rise above them; arise again.
TIME to live in the moment
And live again.
Let's do something.
Let's start the world all over.

We all fall 'cause,
you get what you want
And you want what you get
And you can't wait for it
And we want what you've got
And we know it's a lot
And we can't fucking wait for it.

Let the blood run out
(it's their blood).

It's our TIME, Take it.
Let us not waste it.
Let the blood pour down,
Taste it.
When their lights go out,
It's less dangerous.
