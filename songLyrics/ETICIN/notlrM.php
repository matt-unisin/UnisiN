<h3>Night of the Living Room</h3>
<pre>
You can feel it coming
Straight back to you.
It's that feeling something's
In your room.
Run to lock all the windows.
Scramble to lock all of the doors.
Somebody's waiting
Underneath your bed.
Run to hide under covers.
Bury your face in your hands.

It's over for you.
There's no one left
To save you now;
A false sense of security.
Blood spatter paints
The vacant walls.
Darkness is where 
You'll find me.

How can you sleep when
There's something lurking?

I know it's dark now.
I know it's oh, so very.
Out of the darkness,
Insanity is temporary.
The knife on the nightstand;
I think you've watched
One too many movies
Alone in the darkness
And now, it's all that you can see.
"It's coming for me!"

The darkness is where
You'll find me.
