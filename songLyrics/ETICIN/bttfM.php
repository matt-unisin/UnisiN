<h3>Back to the Furniture</h3>
<pre>
In space and TIME,
We live out lives
Through what we have
Within our minds.
What we can see,
We look with eyes;
The visible spectrum,
The rest, we're blind.
Remember back
To the future plans.
You took so long
To give thanks back.
We talk so much,
With nothing said.
Don't look now 'cause,
That moment's passed.

There was never enough
TIME to bide me.
Don't always go with the
Flow with what's happening
And now, it's TIME to.

Give someone the <span id="blank">____</span> of day.
There is no <span id="blank">____</span> like the present.
<span id="blank">____</span> Is of the essence.
Now, that TIME's gone.
Standing the test of <span id="blank">____</span>.
<span id="blank">____</span> goes marching on.
<span id="blank">____</span> flies when you have fun.
Now, that TIME's gone.

Let go of the past.
Live life in the now.
Fear not for the future.

I will never be
One with society
'Cause, I was always
Alone with that company
And now, it's TIME to die.

Don't let it get away,
Baby, blooming into childhood,
Changing into teenage,
Turning into mother,
Fucking into father TIME.
