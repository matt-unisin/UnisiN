<h3>Beast Wrong</h3>
<pre>
He threw his eyes
In our direction;
Back to his face
Inside the mirror
And threw his sword
On the floor;
Takes a step back.
He don't wanna
Take that path.
Rise above.
Lift the blindfold.
You've gotta
Bring yourself to

Rise above the hate
'Cause, it's equal to
That which you take.

What can we take from this?
What can be learned from this?
This confrontation makes us
Weak inside.

What does it do for you?
What does it do for me?
What does it do for us?
Woah.

Rise above the hate
'Cause, it's equal to
That which you take.
Rise above all the
Violence and hate!

I see you.
I can hear you calling for...
Rise above and now
That conversation's over.

It's TIME for us
To rise above
And come together
Right now.
