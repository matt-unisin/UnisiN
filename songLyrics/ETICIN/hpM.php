<h3>Harry Plotter</h3>

"Lies!"

Just because I look
Something like them,
Doesn't mean I
Fucking am like them.
I've got my own way of
Doing things like them
But, not the same 'cause,
I'm not a thing like them.

My sea of doubt
Washes over me
As I see you, now,
turn to walk away.

Just because I look
Something like them,
Doesn't mean I
Fucking am like them.
I've got my own way of
Doing things like them
But, not the same 'cause,
I'm not a thing like them.

Run until you're out of TIME,
Never checking out alive,
Run and tell your kids
A fucking lie!

Just because I look
Something like them,
Doesn't mean I
Fucking am like them.
I've got my own way of
Doing things like them
But, not the same 'cause,
I'm not a thing like them.

My sea of doubt
Washes over me
As I see you, now,
turn to walk away.
