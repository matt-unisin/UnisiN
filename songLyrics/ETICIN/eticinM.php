<h3>Every Time Is<br />
Contained In Now</h3>
<pre>
As I was on the down and out,
Thought that only time would tell
When my life would turn around
And I'd awaken from this spell.
Time heals everything, they say

But, time is only an illusion.
Every time is contained in now.
Break away from that delusion
To conceal what life is about.
Time to break away from time.
