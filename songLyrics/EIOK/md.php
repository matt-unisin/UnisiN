<h3>Manifest Definitely</h3>
<pre>
This Saturday,
I want to talk about
The devious actions
I've been conscious of.
I've been trying
To say nothing aloud
But, I know you'll deceive
Me next TIME around.

So much TIME;
So many ways,
I let you know
That I can see it.
Don't wanna stoop
To that level today
But, sometimes we
Can't have it that way;
Wanting to hurt you inside;
Get you back by sleeping
With everything in sight.

Place your hand inside mine.
Am I getting to know you?
I'm reliving lives;
Coming and going
But, I don't wanna
Bring back the 70's.
All I really want
Is to be free;
Making my choices right
So, TIME to lose you;
Returning to the dark side.

So, now, I feel like
Every TIME I take my chances,
Chances are,
I'm gonna be let down.
All I want is to trust in you
And not build up the walls
So you can tear me down

So, TIME to bide my TIME.
TIME to say
"Good luck next TIME."
TIME to say "goodbye."
TIME to say
"Good luck next TIME."
I want to ignore the 
Choices in my life.
