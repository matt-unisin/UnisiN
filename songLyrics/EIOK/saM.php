<h3>Sour Apple</h3>
<pre>
Oh, the seasons change
Though, they end up the same.
All that I see here is gray.
Thrown in the obliterator,
Trying to get away,
Wanting to make this place
A better home for you and me.

Driving now for hours,
Leaping to the next town.
Have I been disgraced,
Leaving nothing but a trace?

The belief that
My "perfect life"
Is just a step away
Well, it leads me nowhere
But, left out,
Turning sour,
Been forgotten,
Forever.

All the lonely hours
I've spent wondering what
Happened to all the ones I'd loved,
Born from the family what I was.
