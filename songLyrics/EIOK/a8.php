<h3>Alien 8</h3>
<pre>
Something burns 
Inside of me
And I can feel it come in.
Everything else starts
To fade out, now.
The blood inside
Me starts to show
Into my face and
You all know
Anxiety has got
Me so strung out.

Well, I guess that's
What I get for thinking
That I could have a
Few good friends.
Exactly what am
I supposed to say?
Diffidence.

So, I've got my way of life
And I know you'll never get it.
I don't wanna bring
It out right now
So, I push you all away;
Fade back into
My lonely cage;
Sit and plot my
Plans of breaking out

'Cause, I don't think that
I can bear this anymore.
For me, it's time to
Make a change.
Why do I have to regret
Whatever happens in the end?
Too much anxiety.
