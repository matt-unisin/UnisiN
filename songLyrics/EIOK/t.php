<h3>Threads</h3>
<pre>
And so we go around
In circles, passing one by one,
All the problems in our lives.
You used to tell me
I was such a dick to everyone.
I'm hung by a thread off that line.

I told you everything was fine.
It's OK, I'll be gone tonight.

And so we play this game
Of cat and mouse.
We alternate feeding
Each other to the dog.
And how we talk such shit,
I stop to rub your nose in it
And force you to see
I'm not wrong.

I told you everything was fine.
It's OK, I'll be gone tonight.

And everything is OK.
And everything is alight.
