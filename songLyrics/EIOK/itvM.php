<h3>I'm the Victim</h3>
<pre>
Bored and depressed;
It's a sickness.
Everyone says
"I'm the victim"
But, I don't think it's right
And I don't think it's sane.
Well, I don't think it's right;
Don't wanna hear you say it.
Everything is fine.

So, listen...
So, let me ask you...
Well, I'd do anything
To help you...

But, the lesson
I've learned is:
I can't do anything for
Sick people who need to
Learn to listen to you.

When everything, 
You seem to say, is alright,
All I can say is
"TIME to open your eyes!"

So, let them be dead
If they want to.
Don't let them in
Unless they ask you to.

So, now I ask you
For a bit of help back
From my friend.
"Is it too much to ask?" I said
But, now I realize
I guess I've gotta
Do like everyone else,
Doing everything for myself.
