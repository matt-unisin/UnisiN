<h3>Obey</h3>
<pre>
"Wake up!"

Resist the war effort
With protestation.
We fight to protect
The innocent lives
Until the bombs drop
In our own nation,
Turning victims
Into violent minds
But, I don't wanna see
The next spokesman
For this nation
Repeat the lies,
Leading to genocide.
They're gonna drive us
To extinction.

The public relations
Propagandize;
Detract attention
From what goes on;
Turning our focus to
Lesser issues.
We don't even think about
What we've caused
And I wanna believe
That there's something
Good we stand for;
The pursuit of happiness,
Life, liberty,
For the benefit of everyone.

The absolutely corrupted lies
Take power over weakened minds,
Turning into the plight of our TIME.

Oblivious in every way
To everything they say.
Can you listen to your hearts?
You won't listen to your brains.

'Cause, the real war's over.
It's already been won.
It just makes themselves feel good
To have power over eveyone.

Turn to the issue
On television.
How they enrage you,
While politicians
Get paid to make you
Accept mind condition.
Then, when it's over,
That rage is gone.
