<h3>Free Dumb</h3>
<pre>
Why do they play this
$1 over and over?
I try $2 think of
My financial issues
And of my wife.
What are they selling
On the television?
Everything I see,
I wanna "<input type="button" value="buy it now" style="color:black;font-weight:normal;" onclick="return false" onmousedown="openBIN()" />,"
They'll make up my mind

And when they do,
My heart will follow.
I fight the urge
With every breath I take.
Select "yes" $4 it
$2 arrive tomorrow.

<form><input type="radio" name="shipping" value="standard" checked /> Standard shipping $6.99<br /><input type="radio" name="shipping" value="overnight" /> Overnight delivery $19.99<br /></form>
They make it so easy
$2 <input type="button" value="buy" style="color:black" onclick="return false" onmousedown="openB()" /> this stuff
In this day and age.

I Sell myself, 40 hrs/wk,
$2 buy my food
And a place $2 sleep.
Though minimum wage
Ain't enough $2 make it,
I pay $2 make myself feel free.

Fill your empty thoughts
With something dumb;
Something you can't explain
But, you don't ignore.
It's something more
Then living life as they say,
Going on say by day.

So, listen to me now
And understand me later
That freedom is just
Another way of saying death.
This is why I live life
Like there's no tomorrow,
Live my life until there's
Nothing left.

Living is not struggling
To survive,
Wasting away your life,
Struggling to carry on.
There's something wrong
With living life as they say,
Going on say by day.

So, listen to me now
And understand me later
That freedom is just
Another way of saying death.
This is why I live life
Like there's no tomorrow,
Live my life until there's
Nothing left.

The way I see everyday,
I feel there's something wrong
With the world today.
(It's in your head)
Nothing can change
The way I feel.
We have to make a change
In this fucked up world today.

So, listen to me now
And understand me later
That freedom is just
Another way of saying death.
This is why I live life
Like there's no tomorrow,
Live my life until there's
Nothing left.
